adaptive_navbar_redux:

I made this React app as a challenge to myself and to tryout functionality for a customer project. This app renders a navbar which changes color depending on which tab is selected. This is enabled by using a redux store which gets a dispatch from the individual components. The navbar is based on a Material UI component.

Run with npm start
